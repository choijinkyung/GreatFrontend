# Coinbase Pair Programming Challenge - Part I

This repository contains the first part of the Coinbase pair programming interview. The goal is to assess your proficiency in debugging and implementing logic within an existing React application.

## Interview Overview

*   **Duration:** 60 minutes
*   **Skills Evaluated:**
    *   Correctness of Solution
    *   React Fundamentals
    *   Debugging Skills
    *   Collaboration and Communication
*   **Platform:** This interview will be conducted over CodeSignalâ€™s Interview platform. You can familiarize yourself with the IDE in the [CodeSignal Arcade](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade).

## The Challenge

Your task is to make all 6 tests in `src/__tests__/App.test.js` pass by implementing the required logic.

*   **Test File:** The test cases are located in `src/__tests__/App.test.js`.
*   **Solution Files:** You will write your code in the corresponding files inside the `src/utils/` directory (e.g., `ApiClient.js`, `logger.js`, etc.). The files have already been created for you.
*   **Focus:** You only need to write the logic to satisfy the tests. There is no need to modify the test files or understand the intricacies of the testing library setup.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is the most useful command for this challenge.

See the section about running tests for more information.
